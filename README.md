# Sea Invaders

## Sea Invaders
This is a single-player shooter game. The player (a cuttlefish) shoots at attackers (chunks of coral). If you hit all 24 pieces of coral, you win! The game uses HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

## Game and API
- Game: https://elueder.github.io/sea-invaders-client/

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- Canvas

- Bootstrap
- AJAX
- jQuery

## Future Versions
Future versions will include more levels. If you succeed on level 1, the attackers will come back even faster! Currently a leaderboard would not be very exciting given that a player has a maximum score of 24, but this feature will be added after more levels are added.

## Planning
I decided to make a game to challenge my JavaScript skills. I began using Phaser, a JavaScript library for games made in canvas but quickly decided that I would prefer to write a game using pure JavaScript. I started with just one level in which the player can win or lose. In future versions there will be levels with increasing difficulty.
